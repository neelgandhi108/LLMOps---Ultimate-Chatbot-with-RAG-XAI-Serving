## LLMOps Capabilities üåü

### 1. LLM Monitoring

üëÅÔ∏è LLMOps Nexus employs Prometheus for vigilant monitoring of LLM (Large Language Model) serving modules. For demonstration, a Streamlit app serves the LLM, while Prometheus diligently scrapes metrics. Alert configurations are in place to promptly detect any performance issues.

### 2. Auto-triggering LLM Retraining/Fine-tuning

üîß In response to model performance degradation, Prometheus alerts are generated. These alerts are adeptly managed by AlertManager, which coordinates with Argo Events to initiate a retraining pipeline, effectively fine-tuning the model.

### 3. Training, Evaluating, and Logging the Retrained LLM

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Orchestrated by Argo Workflows, the retraining pipeline is customizable for specific LLM retraining, fine-tuning, and performance tracking. MLflow plays a crucial role in logging details of the retrained LLM.

### 4. Triggering the Generation of New Vectors for Fresh Data

üîÑ Leveraging MinIO for unstructured data storage, LLMOps Nexus sets up Argo Events to monitor upload events. When new data is uploaded, a vector ingestion workflow is automatically triggered.

### 5. Ingesting New Vectors into the Knowledge Base

üîç A vector ingestion pipeline, executed by Argo Workflows, uses LlamaIndex to generate and ingest vectors. These vectors are then stored in Milvus, serving as the knowledge base for retrieval-augmented generation.
